Welcome to [ECCE](https://www.ecce-eic.org/)! Here is a check list to get you started on using the ECCE software.

# Sign up

* Software help and discussion chat via BNL MatterMost
  - https://chat.sdcc.bnl.gov/eic/channels/fun4all-ecce 
  - If you do not have BNL account, please email Jin Huang <jhuang@bnl.gov> to get a direct inviation

* [ECCE email lists](https://www.ecce-eic.org/contact), for example
  - [ECCE public email list](https://lists.bnl.gov/mailman/listinfo/ecce-eic-public-l)
  - [Detector Team discussions and announcements](https://lists.bnl.gov/mailman/listinfo/ecce-eic-det-l)
  - [Physics Benchmark Team discussions and announcements](https://lists.bnl.gov/mailman/listinfo/ecce-eic-phys-l)

# Using software builds

ECCE software are build daily and distributed over OpenScienceGrid via [ECCE container](https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/Singularity). Using the containerized software builds ensure reprodcucibility and a binary consistency for studies. 

## Load the container

Get started wtih using the software builds. That includes three options: 
 - If you have a BNL SDCC account (for any experiment), you can directly use the ECCE software
 - If you have access to a scientific computing center that supports OpenScienceGrid CVMFS, such as at Jlab or CERN, please directly load the ECCE container distributed over  OpenScienceGrid CVMFS: example at [JLab](/tutorials_example2_JLab.html) 
 - If you plan to use on local computers, please check out options of [using ECCE container](https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/Singularity). For linux computers, we suggest [Optiopn-1](https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/Singularity#option-1-mount-eic-cvmfs); and for MAC or PC we suggest using [a linux VM](https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/Singularity/blob/master/VirtualBox.md).
 
## Source the environment



## Git setup



# Get started wtih ECCE software

Follow a recent tutorial on simulation.
* 10-min tutorials for [the default macro](https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/macros) 
* Check out the [tutorials](/tutorials_landing_page.html).
* [Mar-2020 software workshop](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/11112/) - the most recent software workshop with video recording.


# I still have questions, what shall I do?

You are all set to start using ECCE software! 

If you have question, please feel free to send your question or suggestions here:
* Search for any software pieces on ECCE software via the [doxygen reference site](https://ecce-eic.github.io/doxygen/)
* Ask question on [ECCE software MatterMost chat](https://chat.sdcc.bnl.gov/eic/channels/fun4all-eccep)
* Directly emailing the simulation ([Jin Huang](mailto:jhuang@bnl.gov) and [Cameron Dean](mailto:jhuang@bnl.gov)) and [computing](https://www.ecce-eic.org/members) teams
