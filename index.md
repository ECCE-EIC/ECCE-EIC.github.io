# Welcome

This is the software documentation for [EIC Comprehensive Chromodynamics Experiment (ECCE)](https://www.ecce-eic.org/) [simulation and reconstruction software framework](https://github.com/ECCE-EIC). 

[![Build Status](https://web.racf.bnl.gov/jenkins-sphenix/buildStatus/icon?job=sPHENIX/sPHENIX_CoreSoftware_MasterBranch)](https://web.racf.bnl.gov/jenkins-sphenix/job/sPHENIX/job/sPHENIX_CoreSoftware_MasterBranch/)
[![Doxygen](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20reference-Doxygen-green.svg)](https://ecce-eic.github.io/doxygen)

This software runs on all types of accounts for [BNL SDCC/RCAF comtputing center](https://www.racf.bnl.gov/). 
For off-BNL scientific computing and mobile users, [a container are prepared](https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/Singularity) to ensure binary consistent result. 
With distribution over the OpenScienceGrid CVMFS, this containerized software is supported to run in major scientific computing centers such as CERN, [JLab iFarm clusters (see example)](/tutorials_example2_JLab.html), and OpenScienceGrid clusters.
