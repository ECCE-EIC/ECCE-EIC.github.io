# Welcome

This is the software documentation for [EIC Comprehensive Chromodynamics Experiment (ECCE)](https://www.ecce-eic.org/) [simulation and reconstruction software framework](https://github.com/ECCE-EIC). 

[![Build Status](https://web.racf.bnl.gov/jenkins-sphenix/buildStatus/icon?job=sPHENIX/sPHENIX_CoreSoftware_MasterBranch)](https://web.racf.bnl.gov/jenkins-sphenix/job/sPHENIX/job/sPHENIX_CoreSoftware_MasterBranch/)
[![Doxygen](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20reference-Doxygen-green.svg)](https://ecce-eic.github.io/doxygen)
[![Singularity](https://img.shields.io/badge/container-Singularity%20via%20CVMFS-green.svg)](https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/Singularity)
[![Default macros](https://img.shields.io/badge/reference-macros-green.svg)](https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/macros)


This software runs on all types of accounts for [BNL SDCC/RCAF comtputing center](https://www.racf.bnl.gov/). 
For off-BNL scientific computing and mobile users, [a container are prepared](https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/Singularity) to ensure binary consistent result. 
With distribution over the OpenScienceGrid CVMFS, this containerized software is supported to run in major scientific computing centers such as CERN, [JLab iFarm clusters (see example)](/tutorials_example2_JLab.html), and OpenScienceGrid clusters. 

# Get started

Please checkout [the day-1 checklist](/tutorials_day1.html) and our [Mar-2021 simulation workshop](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/11112/). We also have slides with some information on office hours, setting up environments and different ways to interface with the ECCE builds such as from RCF or using virtual machines [located here](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/11268/attachments/33707/54249/ECCE_simulations_quick_guide.pdf).
